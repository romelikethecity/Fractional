translating creative ambition into durable economic outcomes.\n\nThis role is for someone who understands that **financial discipline is not a constraint on creativity — it is the condition that makes creative freedom possible**.\n\nWhy This Role Matters\n\nThe CFO will be one of the most critical architects of Quentasia’s future.\n\nThis role will directly influence:\n\n* How capital is raised, structured, and protected\n* How investors experience transparency and trust\n* How creative projects are financed without compromising values\n* How Quentasia earns credibility with institutional allocators\n\nThis is an opportunity to help build a studio that treats finance not as a back\\-office function, but as a core strategic capability.\n\nKey ResponsibilitiesCapital Strategy \\& Investor Stewardship\n\n* Co\\-lead capital raising across equity, debt, and strategic partnerships.\n* Represent Quentasia in conversations with family offices, institutions, banks, and strategic

realities.\n* Coordinate with production accounting teams to ensure consistency and discipline across projects.\n\nStrategic Partnership with the CEO\n\n* Serve as the CEO’s closest partner in evaluating trade\\-offs between growth, capital deployment, and long\\-term sustainability.\n* Provide clear, principled counsel in moments of ambiguity or pressure.\n* Help shape the long\\-term operating model of the studio as it scales.\n\nCulture, Integrity \\& Financial Leadership\n\n* Uphold Quentasia’s values in all financial dealings.\n* Model integrity, clarity, and accountability in

Comfortable operating in a lean, evolving organization while building for scale.\n* High emotional intelligence, strong communication skills, and investor presence.\n* A principled operator who believes finance exists to enable excellence, not restrict it.\n\nEngagement Structure\n\nBecause Quentasia is in a pre\\-funding and early scaling phase, this role will begin as:\n\n* Advisory or fractional, transitioning to full\\-time as financing milestones are achieved\n* Active participation in capital strategy and leadership formation\n* Advisory equity participation to reflect early belief and contribution\n* Full compensation package (salary \\+ equity) activated post\\-funding\n\nCandidates must be willing to sign a non\\-binding **Letter of Intent (LOI)** confirming interest in being identified as part of Quentasia’s founding leadership circle.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nMost studios hire CFOs to manage budgets.\n\nAt Quentasia, you will help design the financial system that makes ambitious, values\\-aligned storytelling sustainable at scale.\n\nYou will help build a studio where capital is disciplined, transparency is non\\-negotiable, and financial leadership is a source of strength — for creators, investors, and the company alike.\n\nPay: $225,000\\.00 \\- $250,000\\.00 per year\n\nApplication Question(s):\n\n* Are you willing to begin this role in an advisory capacity, with compensation in the form of equity until funding is secured?\n* Are you comfortable participating in early leadership discussions and senior\\-team selection prior to full funding?\n* Are you willing to sign a non\\-binding Letter of Intent (LOI) confirming interest in a future leadership role and allowing us to present your name and resume to investors?\n* Do you understand that this opportunity is pre\\-funding and does not include salary or benefits at the initial advisory stage?\n\nWork Location: In person",
