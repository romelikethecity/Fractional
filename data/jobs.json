While small in size, High Criteria is a tenured and well-established organization with a long-standing reputation in niche government markets—particularly within courts, municipalities, and law enforcement.\n\nHigh Criteria is most widely recognized through its Liberty Recording brand of software products, which are deployed across 10,000+ courts and public-sector environments globally.\n\nOur growth is intentional and relationship-driven. We prioritize trust, reliability, and long-term partnerships over aggressive volume-based selling, an approach that has enabled us to consistently gain market share year over year.\n\n**Engagement Overview**\n\nHigh Criteria is seeking a Sales & Marketing Operations Specialist to support and expand our footprint in government and public-sector markets, with a focus on our principal software and technology offerings.\n\nThis engagement is intended for a professional who operates independently, understands relationship-driven business development, and can collaborate closely with internal stakeholders to support revenue growth through coordination, partner enablement, and market presence. This is not a cold-sales role and not a pure marketing engagement. The scope is focused on supporting long-cycle government sales efforts through execution, organization, and external coordination.\n\nThe ideal partner represents the best combination of skill, judgment, reliability, and cultural fit. While relevant experience is important, trust, trainability, and long-term alignment are equally critical.\n\n**Engagement Term**\n\n* **Initial term:** 90 days\n* **Extension:** May be extended to a one-year engagement based on mutual agreement\n* **Renewal:** Annual renewals may be considered thereafter\n\nContinuation beyond each term is based on mutual agreement and business need.\n\n**Scope of Services**\n\n**Business Development Support (Primary Focus)**\n\n* Support government and public-sector market development efforts\n* Maintain and grow relationships with:\n* Dealers, integrators, and technology partners\n* Public-sector stakeholders\n* Assist with outreach strategies aligned to long-cycle government sales\n* Represent Liberty Recording at industry events and trade shows (travel expected)\n* Ensure consistent follow-through across active initiatives\n\n**Sales Operations & Partner Support**\n\n* Support partner-facing needs, including:\n* Product demonstrations\n* Sales collateral coordination (flyers, spec sheets, info sheets)\n* Serve as a coordination point for sales enablement materials\n* Collaborate with internal teams to ensure accuracy and consistency of shared information\n\n**Marketing Coordination**\n\n* Assist with coordination of:\n* Website content updates\n* Blog and newsletter publishing\n* LinkedIn presence\n* Event and trade show materials\n* Ensure content aligns with government buyers and partner expectations\n* Bonus (not required): basic video or multimedia support\n\n**Additional Scope**\n\nAdditional services may be mutually agreed upon as part of the engagement scope as business needs evolve.\n\n**Experience & Background**\n\n* Marketing or B2B sales experience in at least one of the following environments:\n* Commercial AV industry\n* Government or public-sector markets (preferably law/judicial)\n* Experience working in niche, relationship-driven markets\n* Strong organizational and communication skills\n* Ability to manage multiple initiatives independently\n* Willingness to travel within the U.S. approximately once per month\n\n**Engagement Structure & Expectations**\n\n* This is an independent contractor (1099) engagement\n* Compensation structured as an annual contract value, commensurate with experience\n* Travel expenses reimbursed in accordance with engagement terms\n* No employer-sponsored benefits are provided\n\n**Location**\n\n* Remote (U.S.-based preferred)\n* Travel required approximately once per month\n\n**Candidate Fit**\n\nThis engagement is **not a fit** for individuals who:\n\n* Are seeking quota-based cold sales\n* Expect a traditional employment structure\n* Require fixed working hours or direct supervision\n* Prefer narrowly defined, single-function roles\n\nPay: $70,000.00 - $90,000.00 per year\n\nEducation:\n\n* Bachelor's (Required)\n\nExperience:\n\n* B2G: 1 year (Required)\n\nLanguage:\n\n* English (Required)\n\nLocation:\n\n* United States (Required)\n\nWork Location: Remote",

With or without us, this is your calling.\n* Startup scrappiness — You know what you’re signing up for. You’re familiar with the scrappiness of owning something from start to finish\n* Previous founding experience — You have co-founded a product company or B2B SaaS venture or have been at a venture-backed company\n* Risk appetite and capacity — Read more on our post on the Entrepreneurial Risk Profile\n* GTM chops — Proven success in B2B SaaS sales, marketing, and customer engagement\n* Fundraising fluency — Able to craft investor narratives and close capital; well-networked in fintech and early-stage communities\n* People leadership — Magnet for top talent; coach and culture carrier\n* Bonus: Exposure to home services, call center, VoiceTech, or conversational AI\n\n### **What You Can Expect**\n\n* Daily active engagement with our team to: launch initial product, achieve initial market traction and prepare for seed fundraise\n* Full P/L ownership of the new entity\n* A significant equity stake in the business\n* This is a full-time role; we are looking for someone to commit full-time and exclusively to building and owning a new SaaS venture\n\n### **Ready to Build?**\n\nIf this is the perfect opportunity for you, we want to hear from you!\n\nSubmit your Resume and LinkedIn profile and tell us more about why you think we should chat!\n\nFutureSight is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

John Carbrey (San Francisco), a successful software entrepreneur and people leader, adds deep insight into scaling startups from 0 to 1, having built and exited multiple prior SaaS ventures.\n\n### **What We Bring**\n\n* Validated problem — You will enter a venture with a proven market need and strong momentum toward building and scaling\n* Studio bench strength — Designers, engineers, growth marketers, and fundraising pros are embedded from Day 1\n* Capital commitment — Initial pre-seed funding for early hires and building the MVP with potential for follow-on funding, and access to our investor and advisor network\n\n### **What You Bring**\n\n* Founder-level drive — You’re motivated to co-found a new venture as the CEO. With or without us, this is your calling.\n* Startup scrappiness — You know what you’re signing up for. You’re familiar with the scrappiness of owning something from start to finish\n* Previous founding experience — You have co-founded a product company or B2B SaaS venture or have been at a venture-backed company\n* Risk appetite and capacity — Read more on our post on the Entrepreneurial Risk Profile\n* GTM chops — Proven success in B2B SaaS sales, marketing, and customer engagement\n* Fundraising fluency — Able to craft investor narratives and close capital; well-networked in fintech and early-stage communities\n* People leadership — Magnet for top talent; coach and culture carrier\n* Bonus: Exposure to home services, call center, VoiceTech, or conversational AI\n\n### **What You Can Expect**\n\n* Daily active engagement with our team to: launch initial product, achieve initial market traction and prepare for seed fundraise\n* Full P/L ownership of the new entity\n* A significant equity stake in the business\n* This is a full-time role; we are looking for someone to commit full-time and exclusively to building and owning a new SaaS venture\n\n### **Ready to Build?**\n\nIf this is the perfect opportunity for you, we want to hear from you!\n\nSubmit your Resume and LinkedIn profile and tell us more about why you think we should chat!\n\nFutureSight is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Continued corporate development is a key value driver for the business going forward, with a highly fragmented market of service providers, often individually unable to scale due to lack of technology\\-enablement and offshore capabilities.\nIn late 2022, New Harbor Capital made a growth equity investment in Escalon Services.  \n\n\nAbout New Harbor Capital\nNew Harbor Capital is an experienced, lower middle\\-market private equity firm that seeks to partner with growth\\-minded, founder\\-owned companies.
